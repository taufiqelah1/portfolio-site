## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Project

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This will:
- Start a local server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Automatically open the site in your default browser
- Watch for file changes (with hot reload if using `npm run dev`)

### Alternative: Simple Server

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can also:

**Using Python:**
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 3000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

**Or simply open `index.html` directly in your browser** (though some features may be limited without a server)
